This program is used to created a heatmap of the world of where players
for a particular team are drafted from. It can be set to be a team or of
all teams using the ALL constant in the birth.py script. Keep in mind,
Google GeoCoder has a limit of 1500 calls a day, so this can get pretty
close or exceed that when using all players.

To use simply create a folder called images, change the team in birth.py,
use "python birth.py", then use gifcreator.py to make the images into a
gif.
